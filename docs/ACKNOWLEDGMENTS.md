# Acknowledgments

ralph-go is built on the shoulders of giants. This project would not be possible without the following open source libraries and tools.

## Core Dependencies

### Charm

The terminal UI is powered by [Charm](https://charm.sh/)'s exceptional Go libraries. Their work on making beautiful, functional terminal applications accessible to everyone is truly inspiring.

- **[Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)** - The Elm-inspired TUI framework that powers ralph's interface. Its elegant architecture makes building complex terminal applications a joy.

- **[Lip Gloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss)** - Style definitions for terminal layouts. Makes it easy to create beautiful, consistent UI without fighting ANSI codes.

- **[Bubbles](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles)** - Common TUI components. A great collection of reusable widgets.

- **[Log](https://github.com/charmbracelet/log)** - A minimal, colorful Go logging library.

Charm's commitment to developer experience and their "make the terminal glamorous" philosophy aligns perfectly with what we're trying to achieve with ralph.

## Inspiration

### Anthropic's Ralph Loop

ralph-go is inspired by [Anthropic's Ralph Loop plugin](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official/blob/main/plugins/ralph-loop/README.md) - a self-referential AI development methodology that enables continuous iteration without external scripts.

### Claude Code

This project orchestrates [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) instances. Claude Code is Anthropic's CLI tool for AI-assisted software development.

## Research

### Recursive Language Models

The architecture is informed by research on Recursive Language Models (RLMs), which demonstrate how complex tasks can be decomposed through recursive LLM invocations with bounded context windows.

## Thank You

To everyone who builds and maintains open source software - your work makes projects like this possible.
